## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

**Project Goals for KlipNote:**

1. **Enable self-service transcription workflow** - Non-technical users can independently convert meeting recordings to LLM-ready text without technical assistance
2. **Eliminate cost and duration barriers** - Provide unlimited, free transcription for 1-2 hour meetings that paid services restrict
3. **Validate data flywheel foundation** - Collect human-edited transcriptions as training data to enable continuous quality improvement
4. **Prove technical feasibility** - Demonstrate self-hosted GPU architecture reliably handles concurrent transcription jobs for 10-20 users
5. **Ensure transcription accuracy meets production standards** - Validate transcription outputs against hand-verified ground truth, establish baseline accuracy metrics (CER/WER), enable continuous quality monitoring across releases, and provide objective data for model selection decisions

### Background Context

Finance industry professionals and office workers (particularly in Chinese-speaking markets) regularly record meetings but face a critical workflow bottleneck: converting recordings into text for LLM processing (meeting minutes, action items, analysis). Paid transcription services impose cost barriers ($120-360/year) and duration limits (10-30 min free tiers), while open-source tools like Whisper CLI require terminal expertise that non-technical users lack.

KlipNote solves this by combining state-of-the-art transcription accuracy with a zero-friction web interface accessible from any device. The integrated click-to-timestamp review interface transforms tedious verification into rapid workflow, while every human correction becomes training data for continuous model improvement - establishing a self-improving system that deepens its competitive advantage with usage. Chinese/Mandarin meeting transcription represents the primary use case, requiring specialized optimization for accurate subtitle-length segmentation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**File Upload & Processing**

- **FR001:** System shall accept audio and video file uploads via web interface
- **FR002:** System shall support common media formats including MP3, MP4, WAV, M4A, and other formats supported by FFmpeg
- **FR003:** System shall process uploaded media files using empirically validated transcription model (BELLE-2 or WhisperX selected for MVP based on Epic 3 A/B comparison; both models validated, multi-model support planned for post-MVP Epic 4) with word-level timestamps, automatically detecting and preserving the original audio language
- **FR003b:** System shall optimize Chinese/Mandarin transcription quality as primary use case with segment lengths suitable for subtitle editing workflows (typically 1-7 seconds per segment, maximum ~200 characters)
- **FR003c:** System shall expose enhancement pipeline configuration via API parameters, enabling dynamic control of VAD, timestamp refinement, and segment splitting components on a per-request basis
- **FR004:** System shall queue multiple transcription jobs and process them sequentially using available GPU resources

**Transcription Display & Management**

- **FR018:** System shall persist original transcription outputs with timestamps
- **FR019:** System shall store human-edited transcription versions to enable data flywheel analysis
- **FR020:** System shall persist user edits to browser localStorage to prevent data loss during browser refresh or accidental navigation

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR001: Performance** - Transcription processing shall complete at 1-2x real-time speed (1 hour audio = 30-60 min processing). UI shall load in <3 seconds, media playback shall start within 2 seconds, and timestamp seeking shall respond in <1 second.

- **NFR002: Usability** - Non-technical users shall complete the upload → review → export workflow without documentation or technical assistance. System shall provide clear error messages and visual feedback throughout all operations.

- **NFR002b: Developer Productivity** - Developers shall be able to test complete API workflows using HTTP-based CLI tools without environment-specific setup complexity or virtual environment switching

- **NFR003: Reliability** - System shall achieve 90%+ transcription completion rate (successful upload → export). Browser-based state shall prevent data loss during normal operation including page refresh and accidental navigation, with clear warnings for potentially destructive actions like leaving during upload.

- **NFR004: Compatibility** - Web interface shall function on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers including Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, and Edge 90+. System shall handle media files up to 2 hours duration (primary constraint for GPU processing). File size limit of 2GB serves as practical upload boundary, though actual constraint is processing duration.

- **NFR005: Transcription Quality**

  **Accuracy Targets:**
  - Character Error Rate (CER) ≤ 10% for Chinese audio
  - Word Error Rate (WER) ≤ 15% for Chinese audio
  - Measured against hand-verified ground truth transcripts
  - Continuous regression testing using standardized test samples

  **Format Quality:**
  - Subtitle segments shall conform to industry-standard length conventions for subtitle editing workflows
  - Segments should typically span 1-7 seconds with maximum ~200 characters to ensure usability in review and editing interfaces
  - Segmentation differences acceptable if within subtitle format standards
  - Chinese/Mandarin transcription quality is prioritized as the primary use case

  **Quality Validation:**
  - Hand-verified test samples: zh_long_audio1, zh_medium_audio1, zh_short_video1
  - Baseline CER/WER metrics tracked across releases
  - Automated accuracy regression tests in CI/CD pipeline

  **Model Selection:** Determined through empirical A/B testing in Epic 3 (Stories 3.2b-3.2c) validating both BELLE-2 and WhisperX across comprehensive metrics: CER/WER accuracy, segment length compliance (1-7s / ≤200 chars), gibberish elimination, processing speed, and GPU memory efficiency. MVP ships with [selected model TBD based on Story 4.6b accuracy baselines], multi-model framework deferred to post-MVP Epic 4.

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Office Worker Transcribes Meeting for LLM Processing (Happy Path)

**Persona:** Sarah, Finance Analyst - non-technical office worker, recorded a 45-minute client meeting on her phone

**Goal:** Convert meeting recording to text for ChatGPT to generate meeting minutes

**Steps:**

1. **Access KlipNote**
   - Sarah opens Chrome on her laptop and navigates to the KlipNote URL provided by IT
   - Landing page shows simple upload interface with clear instructions

2. **Upload Recording**
   - Sarah clicks "Choose File" button and selects her meeting recording (MP4, 120MB)
   - She clicks "Upload and Transcribe"
   - System confirms upload successful and shows "Transcription in progress..."

3. **Monitor Progress**
   - Progress bar appears showing "Processing: 15% complete"
   - Sarah switches to another tab to check email while waiting
   - After ~30 minutes, she returns and sees "Transcription Complete!"

4. **Review Transcription**
   - Screen displays scrollable list of timestamped subtitle segments
   - Integrated media player at top shows her meeting video
   - Sarah clicks on a subtitle segment around minute 12 where client discussed budget
   - Video instantly jumps to 12:03 timestamp and plays

5. **Edit Errors**
   - Sarah notices AI transcribed "fiscal quarter" as "physical quarter"
   - She clicks the subtitle text and edits it inline
   - She continues scanning, finds a few client names misspelled, corrects them
   - Total editing time: 4 minutes for 45-minute meeting

6. **Export Results**
   - Sarah clicks "Export" button at bottom of page
   - She selects "TXT format" (for LLM use)
   - Browser downloads "meeting-transcript.txt" to her Downloads folder

7. **Use in LLM Workflow**
   - Sarah opens ChatGPT, pastes the transcription text
   - Prompts: "Generate meeting minutes with action items"
   - Receives formatted meeting minutes in 30 seconds

**Outcome:** Sarah transformed 45-minute meeting into actionable minutes in ~35 total minutes (30 min transcription + 4 min editing + 1 min export/LLM), compared to 2+ hours of manual transcription or $12 paid service charge.

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero technical assistance required
- Clear status feedback throughout process
- Click-to-timestamp enabled rapid verification
- Export format worked seamlessly with LLM tool
